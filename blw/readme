    Block Localized Wavefunction(BLW)

mf.block = [[26,48],[10,19]] means 26 electrons and 48 basis sets in 1st block, 10 electrons and 19 basis sets in 2nd block. The blocks are splitted by the order of atoms.
It is right in PySCF-2.3 comparing with gamess-blw, will be optimized and transfer to latest pyscf version later.
